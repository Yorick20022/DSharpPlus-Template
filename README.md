## :wave: Welcome

- This repository contains all the example code shown in the Tutorial Videos. Refer to this if you need any example code that was shown in the videos for additional help
 
- This bot was coded in C#, .NET Core 8, using the [DSharpPlus](https://dsharpplus.github.io/DSharpPlus/) library. Please note that you cannot mix and match multiple Discord Libraries in one project

- It is advised to only use this repository as a reference/guide, you may not find all the answers to any bugs, issues, or problems with your bot. It is up to the developer to be able to research and find solutions to their problems!!!

- This repository is an updated version of [Bot-Tutorial-Code-OLD-](https://github.com/samjesus8/Bot-Tutorial-Code-OLD-), which is now a discontinued, unmaintained repository. You can still refer to this repository for any code you might need, however, some parts of the code might be outdated, so please adapt it to the current state of your project.
